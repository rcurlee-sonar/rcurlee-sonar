- ⚡ Fun fact: Beer yeast is domesticated, meaning it can't survive on its own in the wild. Also, 
        the difference between ale yeast and lager yeast is not top fermenting vs. bottom fermenting,
        nor is it temperature they "thrive" at, as some claim (although it's true that most lagers
        are fermented colder than most ales). The difference is that they're different species of yeast;
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ale) and Saccharomyces pastorianus (lager).
